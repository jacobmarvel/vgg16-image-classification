# VGG16 Image Classification Project

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the use of the VGG16 model, a convolutional neural network model known for its efficiency in image recognition tasks. The VGG16 model, developed by the Visual Graphics Group at Oxford, has been a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, particularly in image classification challenges.

## Project Overview

The project showcases how to leverage the VGG16 model for classifying images into various categories. It includes examples of preprocessing images to fit the input requirements of the model, utilizing transfer learning to adapt the VGG16 model to specific classification tasks, and evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset.

## Getting Started

To run the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
